# Variants: position and possible consequences

Speaker: Johan den Dunnen

Combination of variant should make sense.  

## Terminology

1. Mutation:
  * biology: change
  * medical: disease-causing change
2. Polymorphism:
  * biology: change in > 1% population
  * medical: not disease causing change
3. Neutral terms for change:
  * sequence variant
  * alteration
  * CNV (Copy Number Variant)
  * SNV (not SNP)

## Variants basic types

1. Category by types of changes:
  * Change in sequence
  * Change in amount
  * Change in position (time and space)
2. Category by number of bases involved:
  * small changes
    * substitution
    * few nucleotide changes
      * deletion
      * duplication
      * insertion
      * indel
  * large changes (Structure changs)
    * translocation
    * insertion (large fragments)
    * transposition
    * copy number variant (CNV)
      * deletion
      * duplication (insertion)
    * inversion
    * conversion
    * complex
 
## Origin of variants

* Cell cycle
* Damage

## Sequence method

NGS fails to detect:  
* Most structural variants (SV)
* Variants in repeat/variable length sequences
* Variants in highly variable regions
* repeat expansions
* rearrangements covering more than read length
