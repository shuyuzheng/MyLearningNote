# Drug combination

## Input

genenomic data, dose response curve -- > expand to 3D profile data --[gene-gene-interaction-network]--> compress it to 2D again (cell-drug)

compress information: one method/logical of ML

Graph convolutional neural network
* drug structure: graph
* gene-gene-network: graph

saliency map


## Parkinson

input: accelerator, gyscope/ acceleration and rotation rate

augment: reduce the time serial data

## Sleep

Translate: shrink --> and then recover to original data
