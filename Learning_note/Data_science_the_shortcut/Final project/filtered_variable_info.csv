First, there are six different chains of appointment/selection to take into account in constructing this index, all of which are scaled to vary from 0 to 1. First, whether the head of state is directly elected a=1 or not a=0. Second, the extent to which the legislature is popularly elected b. If the legislature is unicameral, b is measured as the proportion of legislators directly elected + half of the proportion that are indirectly elected. If the legislature is bicameral and the upper house is involved in the appointment of the chief executive, the same proportion of directly and half of the indirectly elected legislators is calculated for the upper house; the scores for the lower and upper houses are then averaged. Third, whether the head of state is appointed by the legislature, or the approval of the legislature is necessary for the appointment of the head of state c1=1, otherwise 0.  Fourth, whether the head of government is appointed by the legislature, or the approval of the legislature is necessary for the appointment of the head of government c2=1, otherwise 0.

If the head of state is also head of government v2exhoshog = 1, hosw = 1.
