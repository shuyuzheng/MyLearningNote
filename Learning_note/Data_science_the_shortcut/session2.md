Variable: 

Note about the distribution of variables and the assumption for them in the model.

Types: Dichotomous/Binary, Chategorical, ordinal , Interval/ratio

Values: continuous, discrete 

Univariate Metrics 
 * for Binary variables: proportion, count, variance
 * for categorical variable: frequency or proportion, potential to combination categories
 * for ordinal variables: frequency, proportion, proportion of responses in some set of values, pretending that it's a number.
 * for interval/ratio: mean, median, mode(most common number), min, max, variance, standard deviation.

Quantiles: quantiles of probability distribution

Mean and median:
* mean is not robust to "skewed distribution"
* relation between mean and median will tell you something about your data distribution

Bivariate metrics:
* correlation
* slicing/segmentation
* crosstabs

multivariate metrics: table, correlation, PCA

## Visualization

Don't be too complicated.
