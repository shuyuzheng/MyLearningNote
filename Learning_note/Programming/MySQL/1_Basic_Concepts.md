* **Database**: A database is a _structured_ collection of data.
* **Database management system**: is a system which is designed to add, access and process data stored in a database.
* **Relational database**: a digital database built with _relational model_.
* **Relational model**: This model organizes data into one or more tables (or _entities_). In each table, each row (or _records_, _tuples_) represents a instance of the entity and each column (or _attribute_) represents the values attributed to that instance. There must be a _primary key_ in each table to make them related to other tables. More details: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database).
* **SQL** (Structured Query Languages): It is a **language** used to communicate with a database. SQL standard is defined by ANSI (American National Standards Institute). It has been the standard language for a lot of **relational database management systems**, e.g. Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc.
* **MySQL** is an _Open Source_ SQL **database management system**.
