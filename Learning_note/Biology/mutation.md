# Gene XII; Chapter 1.11 Mutations Changes the Sequence of DNA

## Measurement of mutations

1. Mutation across the entire genome (the rate per genome per generation)
2. Mutation in gene (the rate per locus per generation)
3. Mutation at a specific nucleotide site (the rate per base pair per generation)

## Categories

1. Category by reasons:
  * **Spontaneous mutation**: The mutations as the result of normal cellular operations or random interactions with the environment.
    * The occur of spontaneous mutation is different among species or tissue types within a species;
    * It is rare events
    * Those that have deleterious effects are selected against during evolution.
  * **Induced mutations**: The mutations induced by treatment with certain compounds (which is called **mutagens**)
    * Methods of inducing mutations:
      * modify a particular base of DNA
      * become incorporated into the nucleic acid
    * It can cause a large mount of mutations
    * The **potency of a mutagen** is judged by how much it increases the rate of mutation above background.
2. Category by amount of bases involved
  * **Point mutation**: changes only a _single base pair_ 
    * **Substitution**:
      * **Transition**: pyrimidine to pyrimidine / purine to purine
      * **Transversion**: pyrimidine to purine / purine to pyrimidine
    * **Insertion**
    * **Deletion**

## Revertants (the reversion mutations)

* A point mutation can revert by:
  * restoring the original sequence
  * gaining a compensatory mutation else where in the gene
* An insertion can revert by deletion
* An deletion **cannot** revert

### category
1. By function:
* **Forward mutations**: mutations that inactive a gene.  
* **Back mutations**: mutations that reverts the effects of _forward mutations_.

2. By location:
* **True reversion**: exact reversal of the original mutation.  
* **Second-site reversion**: revertants occurs elsewhere _in_ the original gene, and its effects compensate for the forward mutation.  
* **Suppression reversion**: Mutations in other genes occur to circumvent the effects of mutation in the original gene.
  * **Suppressor**: A locus in which a mutation suppresses the effect of a mutation in another unlinked locus is called a suppressor.
