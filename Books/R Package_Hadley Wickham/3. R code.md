## R code workflow
1. Edit and R file: all R code goes in `R/.` folder.
2. Loading your codes
    * `devtools::load_all()`
    * `Ctrl + Shift + L`
3. Explore the code in the console
4. Rinse and repeat.

## Organizing functions

1. Two **bad** organizations:
* All-in-one
* One-in-one (It's OK if some files only contain one function, particularly if the function is large or has a lot of documentation)

2. File names should be **meaningful** and end in `.R`.

3. Never using filenames that **differ only in capitalization**, in case that some one use case-insensitive file system.

4. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation among code definitions:
* `click_function_name + F2`
* `Ctrl + . + type_function_name`

## Code style
If you're working on someone elses' code, **don't** impose your own style. Instead, read their style documentation and follow it as closely as possible.

# Top-level code

The **difference** between code in _scripts_ and _packages_.

 Differences   |        Scripts         |   Packages    |            need to be consider
---------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------
Run when it is | loaded                 | built         | majority of Package codes is **function**
Environment    | local work environment | outside world | more complicated using environment

## Loading code

* loading script code`source()`: every line of code is executed and the results are immediately made available.
