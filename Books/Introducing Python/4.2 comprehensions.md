# 1. List Comprehensions
structure | example
---|---
[_expression_ for _item_ in iterable] | number_list = [number for number in range(1,6)]
[_expression_ for _item_ in _iterable_ if _condition_] | a_list = [number for number in range(1,6) if number % 2 == 1]
[_tuple_ for _item1_ in _iterable1_ for _item2_ in _iterable2_] | list_of_tuples = [(row, col) for row in rows for col in cols]

# 2. Dictionary Comprehensions

* {*key_expression*: *value_expression* for _expression_ in _iterable_}:
```
word = 'letters'
letter_counts = {letter: word.count(letter) for letter in set(word)}
```

# 3. Set Comprehensions

* {_expression_ for _expression_ in _iterable_}
```
a_set = {number for number in range(1, 6) if number % 3 == 1}
```

# 4. Generator Comprehensions

* (_expression_ for _expression_ in _iterable_)
* There is **no**  tuple comprehension.
* A generator can be run only **once**.
