* A module is just a file of Python code with the .py extension.
* Hierarchy structure of code: data type (words) $\rightarrow$ statements (sentences) $\rightarrow$ functions (paragraphs) $\rightarrow$ modules (chapters)
* We refer to code of other modules by using the import statement.

# 1. Import a module

* "import module": import all contents of module
* "module-qualified name (module.function())" : to call functions in the module. (It's ok to call function by its name only, if the name doesn't cause conflict.) 
* "import module as alias ": import modules with alias which can be used in calling functions(alias.function()).
* "from module import function": import only some of the functions in module.
* "from module import function as alias": import function with alias.
* Consider where you'd like to call module: outside (used by all statements in the script) or inside (used only by the function) the function.

# 2. Module Search Path
Using sys.path you can access and modify the module search path of Python.

```	
import sys
for place in sys.path:
	print (place)
```	

The initial blank output line is the empty string '', which stands for the current directory.
