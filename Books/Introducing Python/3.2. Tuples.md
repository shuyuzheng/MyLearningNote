# 1. Basic

Tuple is similar to a constant list: a sequence of arbitrary items but **immutable**

## 1.1 create 

* `()` : create an empty tuple with a pair of parentheses.

* `element1,`: To make a tuple with one element, follow the element with a **comma**.

* `element1, element2, element3`: To make a tuple with more than one elements it is **not necessary** to add a comma after the last element.

* **Note**: It is the **trailing commas** that really define a tuple. Parentheses are used here to make it readable. It is not necessary.

* **Tuple unpack**: You can assign multiple variables at once:

```python
Tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')
A, B, C = Tuple
```

This Feature can be used to exchange values in **one** statement, **without** using a temporary variable:

```Python
a = 'first word'
b = 'second word'
a, b = b, a
```

* `tuple()`: conversion function of tuple makes tuple from other things.

## 1.2 When should you use tuples instead of lists?

* Tuple use **less space**

* You **can't clobber** tuple items by mistake

* You can use tuples as **dictionary key** (_6. Dictionary_ )

* **Named tuple** can be a simple alternative to objects. 

* Function arguments are passed as tuples.(_Functions_)
