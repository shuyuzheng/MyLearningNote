# 1. Basics

## 1.1 Types and basic mathematical operations
Types: integer and floating point numbers.

|Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| + | addition |
| - | subtraction |
| * | multiplication |
| / | **floating point** division |
| //| **integer** (truncating) division|
| % | modulus (remainder) |
| **| exponentiation|

Tips fot division:

* dividing by 0 will return `ZeroDivisionError`;
* `%` : produce the remainder;
* `//` : return truncated quotient;
* `divmod(m, n)`: return both truncated quotient and remainder.

|Operator = | Example | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| += | a += 8 | a = a + 8 |
| -= | a -= 8 | a = a - 8 |
| *= | a *= 8 | a = a * 8 |
| /= | a /= 8 | a = a / 8 |
| //=| a //= 8| a = a // 8|

## 1.2 Bases conversions
Operator | Bases | Example
--- | --- | ---
0b/0B | binary(2) | 0b10 = 2
0o/0O | octal(8) | 0o10 = 8
0x/0X | hex(16) | 0x10 = 16

## 1.3 Integer overflow
* The number is so big that beyond the largest spaces that computers can handle.

* In python 2 supplies enough spaces for integers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648 (32 bits) or from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (64 bits)

* In python 3 there is **no limit** for integers' size.

## 1.5 Type converts

* `int(_things_)` convert things into integers.

* `float(_things_)` convert things(can be string) into floats.

* Some times **Boolean value**: True could be treated as 1 or 1.0; False could be 0 or 0.0.

* When do operation with mixed numeric types, python will try to **automatically convert** them.
