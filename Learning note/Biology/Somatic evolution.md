**Somatic evolution** is the accumulation of mutations and epimutations in somatic cells during a lifetime, and the effects of those mutations ans epimutations on the fitness of those cells. It is important in the process of aging as well as the development of some diseases, including cancer.

# 1. Natural selection in cancer

Cells in pre-malignant and malignant neoplasms(tumors) evolve by natural selection.

## 1.1 Necessary and sufficient conditions for natural selection

   1. There must be **variation in the population**.
   2. The variable traits must be **heritable**.
   3. That variation must **affect survival or reproduction** (fitness).

* **clone**: a population of cancer cells with the similar mutations.
* **clonal expansion** a clone of cells expands in the neoplasm. It is the signature of natural selection in cancer.

## 1.2 Contributing factors

   1. the formation of local micro-environments
   2. mutational robustness
   3. molecular degeneracy(It occurs when structurally dissimilar components/modules/pathways can perform similar functions under certain conditions, but perform distinct functions in other conditions)
   4. cryptic genetic variation

## 1.3 Multilevel selection

   1. Organism level: cancer is usually fatal so there is selection for genes and the organization of tissues that suppress cancer.
   2. Cell level: there is selection for increased cell proliferation and survival, such that a mutant cell that acquires one of the hallmarks of cancer, will have a competitive advantage over cells that have not acquired the hallmark.
