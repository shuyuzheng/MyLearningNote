# DNA damage
## DNA damage induction
1. Direct damages:
    * single-strand breaks (SSBs)
    * double-strand breaks (DSBs)
    * DNA crosslink
    * DNA-Protein crosslinks
2. Indirect damagesï¼š
    * reactive oxygen species (ROS)
    * reactive nitrogen species (RNS)

* DSBs $\rightarrow$ chromosomal rearrangements: the **most harmful** lesion induced by radiation.

* Sensitive **marker** of ionizing radiation-induced DSBs: Quick phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 **($\gamma$H2AX)**.
